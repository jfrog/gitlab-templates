# Overview
This repository includes pipeline templates for GitLab CI, for a quick and easy integration with the [JFrog Platform](https://jfrog.com/platform/).

The templates use the [.setup-jfrog.yml](https://github.com/jfrog/jfrog-cli/blob/v2/build/gitlab/.setup-jfrog.yml) pipeline script. The script is included by each of the templates, and sets up the integration between the pipeline and the JFrog Platform.

The script does the following:
* Installs [JFrog CLI](https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/CLI/JFrog+CLI)
* Configures JFrog CLI to work with the JFrog Platform
* Sets the build name and build number values with the values of `$CI_PROJECT_PATH_SLUG-$CI_COMMIT_REF_NAME` and `$CI_PIPELINE_ID` respectively, to allow publishing [build-info](https://www.buildinfo.org/) to Artifactory 
* Optionally replaces the default Docker Registry with an [Artifactory Docker Registry](https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/Docker+Registry)    

## Installation
1. Ensure you have the connection details for the JFrog Platform. Don't have a JFrog Platform? [Set up](#Set-Up-a-FREE-JFrog-Environment-in-the-Cloud) a free JFrog Platform instance in the cloud now
2. [Store](#Storing-the-JFrog-Platform-Connection-Details) the JFrog Platform connection details on GitLab
3. Optionally set the URL of your Artifactory Docker Registry as the value of the **JF_DOCKER_REGISTRY** variable
4. [Add](#Adding-the-setup-jfrog-Script-in-Your-Pipeline) the **setup-jfrog** pipeline script in your GitLab pipeline

### Storing the JFrog Platform Connection Details
Store the connection details of your JFrog Platform as [GitLab CI/CD variables](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/variables/) by using one of the following variables combinations:

1. **JF_URL** - Anonymous access (no authentication) 
2. **JF_URL** + **JF_USER** + **JF_PASSWORD**  - Basic authentication
3. **JF_URL** + **JF_ACCESS_TOKEN**  - Authentication with JFrog Access Token. NOTE: When pulling and pushing docker images from/to Artifactory, the **JF_USER** variable is also required, in addition to the **JF_ACCESS_TOKEN** variables

### Adding the setup-jfrog Script in Your Pipeline
#### Including the Script   
The templates included in this repository already have the **setup-jfrog** script included as follows:
```yaml
include:
  - remote: 'https://releases.jfrog.io/artifactory/jfrog-cli/gitlab/.setup-jfrog.yml'
```

You also have the option of downloading the script from [releases.jfrog.io](https://releases.jfrog.io/artifactory/jfrog-cli/gitlab/.setup-jfrog.yml), add it in your project, and include it in your pipeline as follows:  
```yaml
  - local: '.setup-jfrog.yml'
```

You can also include it from one of your projects as follows:
```yaml
  - project: 'my-group/my-project'
    file: '/script/.setup-jfrog.yml'
```

#### Referencing the Script
Once the script is included in your pipeline, you'll need to reference it from any `script` or `before_script` sections in the pipeline as shown below. If the pipeline is running on a Linux or MacOS agent, reference the script as follows:
```yaml
job:
  script:
    - !reference [.setup_jfrog, script]
```

For Windows agents, use:
```yaml
job:
  script:
    - !reference [.setup_jfrog_windows, script]
```

At the end of your `script`, or as part of `after_script`, you should add the cleanup reference (same reference for all OS):
```yaml
job:
  after_script:
    - !reference [.cleanup_jfrog, script]
```

### Additional Optional Variables
Configurations can be done via Project Settings > CI/CD > Variables:

| Variable                | Usage                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| JF_DOCKER_REGISTRY      | Docker registry in Artifactory. For more info, see [Getting Started with Artifactory as a Docker Registry](https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/Getting+Started+with+Artifactory+as+a+Docker+Registry) |
| JFROG_CLI_BUILD_PROJECT | JFrog project key to be used by commands which expect build name and build number. Determines the project of the published build.                                                                                |
| JFROG_CLI_VERSION       | Use a specific JFrog CLI version instead of the latest version. The minimal version allowed is: 2.17.0                                                                                                           |

See more environment variables in the JFrog CLI [documentation](https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/CLI/CLI+for+JFrog+Artifactory#CLIforJFrogArtifactory-EnvironmentVariables).

### Limitations
1. If the `JF_DOCKER_REGISTRY` and `JF_ACCESS_TOKEN` variables are set, then the `JF_USER` variable is required.
2. Build info collection is unavailable when:
    * Working with a docker registry without JFrog CLI.
    * Running separate jobs on temporary agents or docker containers.

### Behind the Scenes
The **jfrog-setup** script is maintained in the [jfrog-cli repository](https://github.com/jfrog/jfrog-cli/blob/v2/build/gitlab/.setup-jfrog.yml). 
The script includes two hidden jobs with scripts named `.setup_jfrog` and `.setup_jfrog_windows`, which can be referenced by the pipeline after the script is included.
