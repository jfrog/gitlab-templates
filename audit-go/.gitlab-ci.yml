# Use this template to audit a Go project for security vulnerabilities with JFrog Xray.
# The `jf audit` command works as follows:
#
# 1. It creates a depedency tree for the project, including the direct and indirect (transitives) depedencies
# 2. Scans the depedency tree with JFrog Xray
# 3. Dispayes the vulnerabilities found
#
# Requirements:
# Configure 'ARTIFACTORY_VIRTUAL_REPO' variable with the virtual Go repository in JFrog Artifactorym
# from which the the depedencies can be resolved.
