# Use this template to audit a Yarn project for security vulnerabilities with JFrog Xray.
# The `jf audit` command works as follows:
#
# 1. It creates a dependency tree for the project, including the direct and indirect (transitives) dependencies
# 2. Scans the dependency tree with JFrog Xray
# 3. Displays the vulnerabilities found
#
# To create the dependency tree, the command expects the dependencies to be presented on the local agent.
# To ensure that, the `jf yarn install` command is executed before the `jf audit` command.
#
# Requirements:
# Configure 'ARTIFACTORY_REMOTE_REPO' variable with the npm repository in JFrog Artifactory
# from which the the dependencies can be resolved.
